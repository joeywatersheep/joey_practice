<p style="margin-left: 20px">
    <p title='Lyrics' style="color: white">
    The world is changing <br>
    The planet's heating up <br>
    What the fuck is going on? <br>
    Rearranging <br>
    It's like everything happened all at once <br>
    Um, what the fuck is going on? <br>
    The people rising in the streets <br>
    The war, the drought <br>
    The more I look, the more I see nothing to joke about <br>
    Is comedy over? <br>
    Should I leave you alone? <br>
    'Cause, really, who's gonna go for joking at a time like this? <br>
    Should I be joking at a time like this? <br>
    I wanna help to leave this world better than I found it <br>
    And I fear that comedy won't help <br>
    And the fear is not unfounded <br>
    Should I stop trying to be funny? <br>
    Should I give away my money? No! <br>
    What do I do? <br>
    Healing the world with comedy <br>
    The indescribable power of your comedy <br>
    The world needs direction <br>
    From a white guy like me (Bingo) <br>
    Who is healing the world with comedy <br>
    That's it! <br>
    The world is so fucked up. Systematic oppression, income inequality, <br>
    The other stuff... <br>
    And there's only one thing that I can do about it. <br>
    Whileâ€” While being paid and being the center of attention <br>
    Healing the world with comedy <br>
    Making a literal difference, metaphorically <br>
    A Jew walks into a bar, and I've saved him a seat <br>
    That's healing the world with comedy <br>
    I'm a special kind of white guy <br>
    I self-reflected, and I want to be an agent of change <br>
    So I am gonna use my privilege for the good (Very cool, way to go!) <br>
    American white guys <br> </p> <p title='Lyrics' style="color: white;margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -700px">
    We've had the floor for at least four-hundred years <br>
    So maybe I should just shut the fuck up <br>
    I'm bored <br>
    I don't wanna do that <br>
    There's got to be another way (Yes) <br>
    For me to help out without standing on the sidelines (Never) <br>
    The wait is over <br>
    I'm white, and I'm here to save the day <br>
    Lord, help me channel Sandra <br>
    Bullock in The Blind Side (Sandra Bullock) <br>
    Healing the world with comedy <br>
    Making a literal difference, metaphorically <br>
    And yes, most likely, they'll pay me, but I'd do it for free <br>
    I am healing the world with comedy <br>
    If you wake up in a house that's full of smoke <br>
    Don't panic, call me and I'll tell you a joke <br>
    If you see white men dressed in white cloaks <br>
    Don't panic, call me and I'll tell you a joke <br>
    Oh, shit <br>
    Should I be joking at a time like this? <br>
    If you start to smell burning toast <br>
    You're having a stroke or overcooking your toast <br>
    If you wake up in a house that's full of smoke <br>
    Don't panic, call me and I'll tell you a joke <br>
    If you see white men dressed in white cloaks <br>
    Don't panic, call me and I'll tell you a joke... Oh, shit <br>
    Should I be joking at a time like this? <br>
    Somebody help me out 'cause I don't know <br>
    And I want to help to leave this world better than I found it <br>
    And I fear that comedy won't help, and the fear is not unfounded <br>
    Should I stop trying to be funny? <br>
    Should I give away my money? No! <br>
    I know what I gotta do <br>
    Healing the world with comedy <br>
    Making a literal difference, metaphorically <br>
    I swore I'd never be back, but now, I'm back on my feet <br>
    And I'm healing the world with comedy <br> </p>

<h2 title="Song Title" style="color: lightgray">Bo Burnham Art Is Dead</h2>

<p style="margin-left: 20px">
    <p title='Lyrics' style="color: white" >Art is dead <br>
    Art is dead <br>
    Art is dead <br>
    Art is dead <br>
    Entertainers like to seem complicated <br>
    But we're not complicated <br>
    I can explain it pretty easily <br>
    Have you ever been to a birthday <br>
    Party for children? <br>
    And one of the children <br>
    Won't stop screaming <br>
    'Cause he's just a little <br>
    Attention attractor <br>
    When he grows up <br>
    To be a comic or actor <br>
    He'll be rewarded <br>
    For never maturing <br>
    For never understanding <br>
    Or learning <br>
    That every day <br>
    Can't be about him <br>
    There's other people <br>
    You selfish ass hole <br>
    I must be psychotic <br>
    I must be demented <br>
    To think that I'm worthy <br>
    Of all this attention <br>
    Of all of this money, you worked really hard for <br>
    I slept in late while you worked at the drug store <br> </p> <p title='Lyrics' style="color: white;margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -550px">
    My drug's attention, I am an addict <br>
    But I get paid to indulge in my habit <br>
    It's all an illusion, I'm wearing make-up, I'm wearing make-up <br>
    Make-up, make-up, make-up, make... <br>
    Art is dead <br>
    So people think you're funny, how do you get those peoples money <br>
    Said art is dead <br>
    We're rolling in dough, while Carlin rolls in his grave <br>
    His grave, his grave <br>
    The show has got a budget <br>
    The show has got a budget <br>
    And all the poor people way more deserving, of the money <br>
    Won't budge it <br>
    'Cause I wanted my name in lights <br>
    When i could have feed a family of four <br>
    For forty fucking fortnights <br>
    Forty fucking fortnights <br>
    I am an artist, please god forgive me <br>
    I am an artist, please don't revere me <br>
    I am an artist, please don't respect me <br>
    I am an artist, you're free to correct me <br>
    A self-centered artist <br>
    Self-obsesed artist <br>
    I am an artist <br>
    I am an artist <br>
    But I'm just a kid <br>
    I'm just a kid <br>
    I'm just a kid, Kid! <br>
    And maybe I'll grow out of it <br> </p>

<h2 style='color: lightgray' title="Song Title">Bo Burnham From God's Perspective</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 20px">
    <p title='Lyrics' style="color: white" >The books you think I wrote are way too thick. <br>
    Who needs a thousand metaphors to figure out you shouldn't be a dick? <br>
    And I don't watch you when you sleep. <br>
    Surprisingly I don't use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep <br>
    You're not going to heaven <br>
    Why the fuck would you think I'd ever kick it with you? <br>
    None of you are going to heaven <br>
    There's a trillion aliens cooler than you <br>
    You shouldn't abstain from rape just 'cause you think that I want you to <br>
    You shouldn't rape 'cause rape is a fucked up thing to do <br>
    Pretty obvious, just don't fucking rape people, please <br>
    Didn't think I had to write that one down for you <br>
    I don't think masturbation is obscene <br>
    It's absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I've ever seen <br>
    You make my job a living hell and I sent gays to fix overpopulation <br>
    And boy did that go well <br>
    You're not going to heaven <br>
    Eat a thousand crackers sing a million hymns <br></p>
    <p title='Lyrics' style="margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -360px; color: white">None of you are going to heaven <br>
        You're not my children <br>
    You're a bad game of Sims <br>
    You shouldn't abstain from pork just 'cause you think that I want you to <br>
    You can eat pork 'cause why the fuck would I give a shit? <br>
    (I created the universe, think I'd draw the line at the fucking deli aisle?) <br>
    You argue and you bicker and you fight <br>
    Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night <br>
    Over what they think is true <br>
    But no one entertains the thought that maybe God does not believe in you <br>
    You pray so badly for heaven <br>
    Knowing any day might be the day that you die <br>
    But maybe life on earth could be heaven <br>
    Doesn't just the thought of it make it worth a try <br>
    My love's the type of thing that you have to earn <br>
    And when you earn it you won't need it <br>
    My love's the type of thing that you have to earn <br>
    And when you earn it you won't need it <br>
    I'm not gonna give you love just 'cause I know that you want me to <br>
    If you want love then the love's gonna come from you <br><p>

    Some better, some worse <br>
    If none of it's of interest to you, you'd be the first <br>

    Come and take a seat <br>
    Would you like to see the news or any famous women's feet? <br>
    There's no need to panic <br>

    Here's a nine-year-old who died <br>
    We got movies, and doctors, and fantasy sports <br>
    And a bunch of colored pencil drawings <br>
    Of all the different characters in Harry Potter fucking each other <br>
    Welcome to the internet <br>
    Hold on to your socks <br>
    'Cause a random guy just kindly sent you photos of his cock <br>
    They are grainy and off-putting <br>
    He just sent you more <br>
    Don't act surprised, you know you like it, you whore <br>
    See a man beheaded <br>
    Get offended, see a shrink <br>
    Show us pictures of your children <br>
    Tell us every thought you think <br>
    Start a rumor, buy a broom <br>

    Or DM a girl and groom her <br>
    Do a Zoom or find a tumor in your <br>
    Here's a healthy breakfast option <br>
    You should kill your mom <br>

    Here's how you can build a bomb <br>
    Which Power Ranger are you? <br>
    Take this quirky quiz <br>
    Obama sent the immigrants to vaccinate your kids <br>

    Apathy's a tragedy <br>
    And boredom is a crime <br>
    Anything and everything <br>
    All of the time <br>
    You know, it wasn't always like this <br>
    Not very long ago <br>
    Just before your time <br>
    Right before the towers fell, circa '99 <br>
    This was catalogs <br>
    Travel blogs <br>
    A chat room or two <br>
    We set our sights and spent our nights <br>
    Waiting <br>
    For you, you, insatiable you <br>
    Mommy let you use her iPad <br>
    You were barely two <br>
    And it did all the things <br>
    We designed it to do <br>
    Now look at you, oh <br>
    Look at you, you, you <br>
    Unstoppable, watchable <br>
    Your time is now <br>
    Your inside's out <br>
    Honey, how you grew<br>
    And if we stick together <br>
    Who knows what we'll do <br>
    It was always the plan <br>
    To put the world in your hand <br>
    Hahaha <br>
    Could I interest you in everything? <br>
    All of the time <br>
    A bit of everything <br>
    All of the time <br>
    Apathy's a tragedy <br>
    And boredom is a crime <br>
    Anything and everything <br>
    All of the time <br>
